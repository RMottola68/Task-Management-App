My name is Ryan Mottola.

This project is meant to organize the user's tasks. They can be marked as completed, separated into active or completed, and then deleted. 

I used ReactJS and ReactRouter, as well as bootstrap, and basic css. 

Improvements: 

I think the state in the contact list could have been organized better, instead of 4 different useStates.

I originally wanted to organize the active/ completed tasks into tabs, but I didn't have enough time to learn how. 

I could have added more state to the tasks, such as descriptions and dates, if I had more time. 

**If I wasn't in a state of panic while learning hooks >AS< I was working on this project, I would have commented everything I was doing. 

User Stories:

As a programmer, I'd like to display the code I need to write in order to work efficiently.

As a human being on planet Earth, I'd like to list anything I need to do so I remember to do them.
